It allows users to combine spatial and spectral details from different sources, enhancing imagery through methods like Fourier transform fusion and interpolation techniques. The package supports multiple downsampling methods, and it also includes features like image denoising, histogram matching, and kernel-based blurring. Key features \u2728 Image fusion : Combines LR and HR images using Fourier-based interpolation and various resampling techniques (e.g., Lanczos, cubic). \ud83c\udf0d Denoising with SwinIR : Utilizes the SwinIR model for efficient image denoising prior to fusion. \ud83e\uddf9 Custom kernels : Apply customizable kernels such as Lanczos and cubic for image processing. \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f Fourier filtering : Supports multiple Fourier filters (ideal, Butterworth, Gaussian) for frequency-domain fusion. \u2699\ufe0f Efficient resampling : Resizes images with support for different interpolation methods like Lanczos and cubic. \ud83d\udcd0 Installation \u2699\ufe0f Install the latest version from PyPI: pip install sathybrid How to use \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Basic Fusion of HR and LR Imagery \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f Load libraries import sathybrid import pathlib Define the paths for high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) images PATH = pathlib .
